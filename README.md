# ScsUnitTypeCheckBypass

Plugin for using Local Mods (Local Only Addon Hookups) in (TruckersMP) ATS/ETS2.

In 1.44 SCS added an attribute type check to units which stopped us from loading Local Mods from our save files.

This plugin changes it so that the type check is ignored.

This is the same plugin that was released years ago, now just made open source and with a download without ads.

### How to use

You can download the plugin from [here](https://github.com/dariowouters/ScsUnitTypeCheckBypass/releases/latest).  
With the game closed place the `ScsUnitTypeCheckBypass.dll` in `<game_install_location>/bin/win_x64/plugins`
(if the plugins folder does not exists, you can create one)

Then you can use Local Mods in your save file and the game will load them.
